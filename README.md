**Overview**

The Patient Tracker System is a digital solution meant to tackle patient management in healthcare. Currently, patients have to request their healthcare for paper documentation about their medications or previous conditions. This is an administrative and time burden for both the healthcare provider and the patient as there are a lot of things to check and look for. This digital solution will offer data security, streamline administrative tasks, streamline information for the patient, and enhance patient care. It serves healthcare providers, their staff, and patients, addressing the challenges of manual paperwork and the need for immediate access to accurate patient information. Furthermore, the digitalization of this process also improves patient privacy and promotes environmental incentives. The system aims to improve efficiency, convenience, and overall healthcare quality.
