Patient Tracker System
The Patient Tracker is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of patient information and medical records. The primary goal is to provide doctors with a convenient and efficient way to access and update patient records during checkups. By digitizing the process, the application eliminates the need for manual paperwork and enhances the overall patient care experience.
Patients will be able to submit their medical records electronically in the system, such as by uploading files or filling out online forms. Once the patient records are stored in the system, dedicated doctors can access and review the necessary details during patient visits. Whenever a patient submits new information or modifies existing records, the system is automatically updated at the doctor’s end. This real-time update mechanism enhances the efficiency of the system and enables doctors to stay informed about the latest developments in a patient’s condition.

Example Interaction
A sample scenario of this system for a Doctor is presented below:
• Doctor logs into the Patient Tracker system using their credentials.
• The system presents a dashboard displaying a list of patients scheduled for the day.
• The doctor selects a patient from the list and accesses their record.
• The patient’s medical history, current medications, and previous diagnoses are displayed on the screen.
• The doctor reviews the information, updates any necessary details and adds new observations or recommendations.
• The updated record is saved securely in the system, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
High Level Goal
The high-level goal of the Patient Tracker is to streamline the process of managing patient information and improve the efficiency of medical care. By providing doctors with easy access to accurate and up-to-date patient records, the application aims to enhance decision-making, increase productivity, and ultimately improve the quality of patient care.
Components
This software system will likely have the following components:
• User Authentication to ensure a secure login system to authenticate patients and doctors and access control to patient records.
• Patient Database that stores patient information, including personal details, medical history, medica- tions, and diagnoses
• An intuitive and user-friendly user Interface
• Data Storage and Security compliant
• Search and Filtering to quickly retrieve information like a list of medications, and a number of previous checkups.
You may choose to focus on some of the above components in greater detail. For example:
• If you focus on data storage and security compliance, you need to implement data encryption, secure data transmission, and access control in place. It is sufficient to have a simple interface and simple search output in this case.
• If you focus on a detailed UI experience for both Doctors and patients, it is sufficient to keep the database and data storage security at a minimal level.
